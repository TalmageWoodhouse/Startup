# MyHabits

[My Notes](notes.md)

MyHabits is an app that most efficiently and easily tracks your daily habits. This list of daily habits can be as long or short as you want. You may also be able to see your streak for each habit to see how well you are doing. This app also allows you to go back and check previous days to check which habits you accomplished on that specific day.
